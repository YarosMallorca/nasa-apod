# NASA APOD

This is a project that utilizes NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API to display daily images and information about the universe.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to create a NASA API key. You can do this by visiting the [NASA API Portal](https://api.nasa.gov/). Once you have your API key, you can add it to the `config.js` file.

```javascript
export const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY";
```
